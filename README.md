Website for my digital portfolio

## WireFrame description:
I felt a simple design would be best as this website will be used for more formal purposes. Keeping it short and sweet with little personal information and all necessary work-related information. I decided a linear form of reading would be simplest so nobody has to worry about jumping from the left side of the screen to the right, not knowing where they should be going. First is a short biography including my student status and a couple interests as well as a photo of me any my favourite instrument. Next is all my work experience. It isn't much, but it will grow over time. Finally there are the three social medias where I am most active and can be reached the easiest.
