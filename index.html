    <h1>Who is Brandon Chattha?</h1>
    <p>I am a second year Simon Fraser University student who enjoys programming and audio-books. I play 3 instruments and spend way too much time and money on video games.</p>
    <p>I just recently made it into my institute's honour roll and plan to stay there for the remainder of my education.</p>
    <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/honour-rolls/deans-honour-roll.html">Simon Fraser University's Honour Roll</a>
    </p>After graduation, I intend to secure employment as either a software developer or cyber-security developer.</p>
    </p>Before then, however, I intend on taking multiple positions in Co-op (apprenticeship) throughout the remainder of my time at Simon Fraser.</p>
