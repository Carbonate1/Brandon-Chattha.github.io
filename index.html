    <h1>Who is Brandon Chattha?</h1>
    <p>I am a second year Simon Fraser University student who enjoys programming and audio-books. I play 3 instruments and spend way too much time and money on video games. <br> just recently made it into my institute's honour roll and plan to stay there for the remainder of my education.</p>
