    <p>I am a third year Simon Fraser University student who enjoys programming, audio-books, and long bike rides. I play 3 instruments and spend way too much time and money on video games.</p>
    <p>
        I've recently made it onto my institute's <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/honour-rolls/deans-honour-roll.html"> Honour Roll</a> (Select the Fall 2024 term) and plan to stay there for the remainder of my education! Additionally, I recently joined the SFU <a href="https://sfussss.org/about">SSSS Executive team</a> (Software Systems Student Society) as the Treasurer and the SFU Jazz Band Executive team (Events Coordinator) where I play saxophone! 
    </p>
    </p>After graduation, I intend to secure employment as either a software developer or cyber-security developer. Before then, however, I intend on taking multiple positions in Co-ops (apprenticeships) throughout the remainder of my time at Simon Fraser.</p>
